# INVertex NRL

The invertex NRL is a FRLNRLTKL With a flippable top case

## Case

The four peice case is connected with taobao ball catch systems and screws for the optional internal weights and large external weight
To flip the layout you can just pop the top case off, flip the case 180deg then clicl the case back into place with the magnetic nav col blocker 
The layout is only flippable with a tadpole plate. If you are looking to flip the nav col with the gasket/Top plate you will have to rebuild the board with a different plate
the weight has taken alot of inspo from the cycle7 with the main gimmick of the board inspired by the flip6p
